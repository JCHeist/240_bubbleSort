Goal- To organize an array numerically

Input- An array of integers in a random order

Output- An array with the integers ordered

Steps- 

main(){
	ask user if they would like to set an array of numbers themselves or use a random set of numbers

	ask how long they would like the array  to be. have them enter teh numbers if they would like or generate a random amount of numbers if they would like
	
	use input number to be the length of the array to be used in the program

	go to menu

}

menu(){
	
	ask user how they would like to sort their array (merge, bubble, selection) and send them there

}


**while doing all sorting methods, keep track of the cycles it takes to sort the array and 

insertionS(){

	set marker to be at the first index... everything to the right of the marker is considered un sorted
	
	move marker up one index. if the value of the number on the right is smaller, swap it with the number on the left

	again if the number on the left is larger, swap it until it is larger than the number next to it

	do this all the way down the loop	

}


bubbleS(){

	compare each index to the index next to it (run through the loop n - 1 times

	dont compare n - 1 index each successive time since it is already in the right order

}


selectionS(){

	set a variable to equal the smallest value as you move across the array

	at end of array, swap smallest value found with the number at the 0th index

	repeat, not scaning the n index and replace the 0 + 1 index witht the smallest number left

}


printValues(){

	print all values out in an array looking format

}
