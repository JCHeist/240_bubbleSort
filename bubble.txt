Goal- To organize an array numerically

Input- An array of integers in a random order

Output- An array with the integers ordered

Steps- 

1)get an array of numbers

2)compare the integer at the 0 index with the integer next to it

3)if it is larger than the number to the right, swap the value

4)compare each number with the number next to it string length minus 1 times to go through each pair
             -the last number will now be the highest. so you dont have to compare the last element in the array
	     -print elements in proper formatting each pass through

5)compare each pair in ehe array and swap them if the one on the left is larger

6)compare the elements to each other again and switch them as you go down the line until you go through the whole array

7)after going through all of the array and it is sorted, print final sorted product
